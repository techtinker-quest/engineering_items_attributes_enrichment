  You are an expert in analyzing engineering drawings. Evaluate the quality of this drawing to determine the best processing approach.
  
  Drawing: {file_name}
  Context: {context}
  
  Analyze the drawing and provide:
  1. Overall quality assessment (0.0 to 1.0)
  2. Text clarity (0.0 to 1.0)
  3. Image quality (0.0 to 1.0)
  4. Complexity level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
  5. Recommended pipeline (BASELINE_ONLY/LLM_ENHANCED)
  
  Consider:
  - Image resolution and clarity
  - Text readability
  - Presence of technical symbols
  - Drawing complexity
  - Whether advanced AI processing is needed
  
  Respond in JSON format:
